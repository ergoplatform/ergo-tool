## Introduction

ErgoTool is a [command-line
interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for
[Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/) blockchain. It is implemented in Scala using
[Ergo Appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit) library. ErgoTool is a Java
application and it can be executed on Java 8 or later compliant JRE. In addition ErgoTool
can be compiled to a native executable using GraalVM's
[native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/). This
capability is inherited from Appkit, which is native-image friendly by design.

Native executables are especially attractive for CLI tools, because of the very fast start
up times (comparing to a typical start up pause of a JVM based executable). Please follow
the [installation instructions](#installation) to setup ErgoTool on your system.

## Installation

Installation of ErgoTool on your computer is simple and depend on how you want to obtain
the executable binary files.
- you can build ErgoTool yourself from source code (which is a recommended method for
security sensitive software) and use the executables generated this way.
- or alternatively (if you trust the developers) you can download pre-built executables and
install from release package.

The instructions below should work on POSIX OSes (i.e. Linux, MacOS) and were tested on
MacOS.

### Build ErgoTool From Source Code

#### 1. Clone ErgoTool repository

You need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.
Open Terminal and use the following commands to clone the ErgoTool source code. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-tool.git
Cloning into 'ergo-tool'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 238, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (238/238), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (124/124), done.
remote: Total 238 (delta 80), reused 206 (delta 48), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (238/238), 42.44 KiB | 517.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (80/80), done.
```
Once the clone operation is complete you can compile ErgoTool.

#### 2. Compile Java Executable

In order to compile ErgoTool you need to have SBT
[installed](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) on your system. 

Run the following commands to build a Java fat jar file with ErgoTool and all the
dependencies needed to run it using the `java` launcher.

```shell
$ cd ergo-tool
$ sbt assembly
```

you should see the output which looks like the following 
```
[info] Loading global plugins from ~/.sbt/1.0/plugins

... test execution results

[info] Packaging ./target/scala-2.12/ergotool-3.1.0.jar ...
[info] Done packaging.
[success] Total time: 33 s, completed Dec 23, 2019 10:23:50 PM
```
Now run the compiled ErgoTool using the following command which runs the ErgoTool application.
Note, you should run this command while in the root folder of the cloned ErgoTool repository.

```
java -cp target/scala-2.12/ergotool-*.jar org.ergoplatform.appkit.ergotool.ErgoTool 
Please specify command name and parameters.

Usage:
ergotool [options] action [action parameters]

Available actions:
  address testnet|mainnet <mnemonic>
	return address for a given mnemonic and password pair
  checkAddress testnet|mainnet <mnemonic> <address>
	Check the given mnemonic and password pair correspond to the given address
  createStorage [<storageDir>="storage"] [<storageFileName>="secret.json"]
	Creates an encrypted storage file for the mnemonic entered by user
  extractStorage <storage file> address|masterKey|publicKey|secretKey mainnet|testnet
	Reads the file, unlocks it using password and extract the requested property from the given storage file.
  extractStorage <storage file> address|masterKey|publicKey|secretKey mainnet|testnet
        Reads the file, unlocks it using password and extract the requested property from the given storage file.
  getBoxInfo <boxId>
        list box content with tokens and register details
  help <commandName>
        prints usage help for a command
  listAddressBoxes [--limit-list <limit>] <address>
        list top <limit> confirmed unspent boxes owned by the given <address>
  listAddressTokens <address>
        list tokens owned by the given <address>
  mnemonic 
	generate new mnemonic phrase using english words and default cryptographic strength
  send <storageFile> <recipientAddr> <amountToSend>
	send the given <amountToSend> to the given <recipientAddr> using 
 the given <storageFile> to sign transaction (requests storage password)

Options:
  --conf
	configuration file path relative to the local directory (Example: `--conf ergo_tool.json`
  --dry-run
	Forces the command to report what will be done by the operation without performing the actual operation.
  --print-json
	Forces the commands to print json instead of table rows.
```

The command prints usage information with the available commands and options.

#### 3. Generate Native Executable 

SBT build for ErgoTool is configured to generate native image using GraalVM's
[native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/) utility. To
make `native-image` available the GraalVM package should be installed on your system. You
can follow [the instruction from Appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit#setup)
to install both GraalVM and native-image. You can also use
[instructions](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) from GraalVM's site.

Ones GraalVM is installed use the following command to compile native image of ErgoTool. 

```shell 
$ sbt graalvm-native-image:packageBin
...
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]    classlist:  29,125.82 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]        (cap):   4,064.53 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]        setup:   6,738.59 ms

[info] [ergo-tool:2393]     (inline):   5,056.85 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]    (compile):  26,131.81 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]      compile:  38,958.14 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]        image:   7,937.35 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]        write:   2,322.71 ms
[info] [ergo-tool:2393]      [total]: 200,278.13 ms
[success] Total time: 208 s, completed Dec 23, 2019 10:43:40 PM
```

This will generate a native executable located in `./target/graalvm-native-image/ergo-tool`.     
Now you can call it from there using the following command and obtain the same usage message.

```shell
$ target/graalvm-native-image/ergo-tool
Please specify command name and parameters.
...
```
The generated `ergo-tool` executable is self-contained and can be moved to any directory
which is on the PATH environment variable.

NOTE, if you receive warning message mentioning `sunec` library like 
```
WARNING: The sunec native library, required by the SunEC provider ...
```
you need to run ergo-tool providing the location of the library using the following command
```
$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GRAAL_HOME/jre/lib target/graalvm-native-image/ergo-tool
```
Here `$GRAAL_HOME` is environment variable pointing to the installation of GraalVM.

### Download ErgoTool Release Package 

Release packages are published on the
[releases](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-tool/releases) page. Please download the
appropriate archive and extract it locally on you computer.

## Commands

The unit of execution in ErgoTool is a command. The command is specified by its name
when the tool is started and it can be followed by options and parameters. 
```
$ ./ergo-tool --conf config.json address mainnet "some secret mnemonic phrase"
```
The command option is given by the name `conf` (with `--` prefix) and the value
`config.json` separated by the whitespace. Options (name-value pairs) can go anywhere in
the command line. All other components which remain after removing all the options are the
command name and parameters (`address`, `mainnet` and the mnemonic in the example).

For further detail of how a command line is parsed see this
[description](https://ergoplatform.github.io/ergo-tool/api/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ergotool/CmdLineParser$.html#parseOptions(args:Seq[String]):(Map[String,String],Seq[String])).

#### ScalaDoc API Reference

ScalaDocs for the latest releases are always [available on project
site](https://ergoplatform.github.io/ergo-tool/api/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ergotool/ErgoTool$.html).
Please submit a PR if
you find typos or mistakes.

#### Preparing for native image generation

You may need to re-generate reflection and resources configs for native-image utility. 
To do that run ErgoToolSpec with `native-image-agent` configured.
The following should be added to command line.
```
-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=graal/META-INF/native-image
```

After that you will have to review changes made in the files and remove unnecessary
declarations.
